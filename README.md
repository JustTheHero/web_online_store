# SCC0219 - Introdução ao Desenvolvimento Web <br/>

## 1. Requirements:
  * The project is a online store system that sells accounts, online coaching sessions and services to increase your rank in online games.
  * The system will have 2 types of users:
      - Administrators, responsible for registering/managing administrators, customers, and products/services provided. The application already comes with an account admin            with password admin.
      - Customers, users who acess the system to buy services/products
  * Each customer and user record includes name, email, address, phone and id fields.
  * Each service/product record includes name, id, photo, description, price, quantity (in stock) and quantity sold.
  * Selling Products (or services): Products are selected, quantity chosen, and are included in a cart. Products are purchased using a credit card number (any number is            accepted by the system). The quantity of product sold is subtracted from the quantity in stock and added to the quantity sold. Carts are emptied only on payment or by          customers.
  * Product/Service Management: Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new products and services. For example, they can change the stock quantity.
  * Users are able to search the desired product/service using a responsible searchbar
  * Users can navigate through different products tabs.
